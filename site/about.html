                            I got the idea from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flutrack.org/">FLUTRACK</a>.  Using
                            twitter to track potiential flu outbreaks by seeing where people were tweeting about their
                            flu symptoms.  I wanted to expand on this idea and plot a heatmap showing potential outbreaks 
                            based on the data returned.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Originally, I wanted to expand this even further and search twitter directly for various 
                            topics and plot the heatmap onto <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com">Google maps</a>.  
                            For example, if you searched for "Trump" or "Immigration" what would the heatmap look like across 
                            the US or the world?  Would you see more activity inside the US for those topics or outside?
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Unfortunately the majority of tweets don't appear to have latitude and longitude associated
                            with them.  I believe I could still get reasonable results by using the location data stored
                            at the user level, but this would have required more time than I currenly have for this project.
